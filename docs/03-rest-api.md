# REST API

When enabled, Assertoor offers a REST API that facilitates interaction with the testing framework, enabling users to programmatically fetch statuses and results of tests and tasks. Additionally, the API supports basic operations such as scheduling or canceling test runs, making it a powerful tool for automating and integrating Assertoor into broader testing and CI/CD pipelines.

## Key Features of the REST API:

- **Status and Results Retrieval**: Users can query the API to obtain detailed status updates and results for both tests and individual tasks, allowing for real-time monitoring and analysis of test executions.

- **Test Management**: The API supports scheduling new test runs and canceling existing ones, providing flexibility in managing test execution according to dynamic testing requirements or conditions.

- **Integration Friendly**: The REST API's standard interface ensures it can be easily integrated with external tools and systems, enhancing Assertoor's utility in automated testing environments.
