## `generate_slashings` Task

### Description
The `generate_slashings` task is designed to create slashing operations for artificially constructed slashable conditions, and send these operations to the network.\
It's important to note that while the slashing operations are sent to the network, the fake attestations or proposals that justify these slashings are never actually broadcasted. This task is vital for testing the network's response to validator misconduct without affecting the actual network operations.

### Configuration Parameters

- **`slashingType`**:\
  Determines the type of slashing to be simulated. Options are `attester` for attestations-related slashing and `proposer` for proposal-related slashing. \
  This setting decides the kind of validator misbehavior being simulated.

- **`limitPerSlot`**:\
  The maximum number of slashing operations to generate per slot.

- **`limitTotal`**:\
  The total limit on the number of slashing operations to be generated by this task.

- **`mnemonic`**:\
  A mnemonic phrase for generating the keys of validators involved in the simulated slashing.

- **`startIndex`**:\
  The index from which to start generating validator keys within the mnemonic sequence.

- **`indexCount`**:\
  The number of validator keys to generate from the mnemonic, indicating how many distinct slashing operations will be created.

  - **`clientPattern`**:\
  A regex pattern for selecting specific client endpoints to send the slashing operations. If not specified, the task will use any available endpoint.

- **`excludeClientPattern`**:\
  A regex pattern to exclude certain clients from being used for slashing operations. This feature provides an additional layer of control by allowing the exclusion of specific clients, which can be useful for testing under various network conditions.

- **`awaitInclusion`**:\
  If set to `true`, the task waits for all submitted slashing proofs to be included in beacon blocks before completing. The task monitors new blocks and checks for both attester and proposer slashings matching the submitted validator indices.

### Outputs

- **`slashedValidators`**:\
  Array of validator indices that were submitted for slashing.

- **`includedSlashings`**:\
  Number of slashings confirmed on-chain (only populated when `awaitInclusion` is enabled).
