## `generate_bls_changes` Task

### Description
The `generate_bls_changes` task is responsible for generating BLS changes and sending these operations to the network. This task is vital for testing the network's ability to handle changes in withdrawal credentials.

### Configuration Parameters

- **`limitPerSlot`**:\
  The maximum number of BLS change operations to generate for each slot. A slot is a specific time interval in blockchain technology.

- **`limitTotal`**:\
  The total limit on the number of BLS change operations to be generated by this task.

- **`mnemonic`**:\
  A mnemonic phrase used to generate validator keys. This is the starting point for creating BLS key changes.

- **`startIndex`**:\
  The index within the mnemonic from which to start generating validator keys. This determines the starting point for key generation.

- **`indexCount`**:\
  The number of validator keys to generate from the mnemonic. This sets how many different validators will have their keys changed.

- **`targetAddress`**:\
  The address to which the validators' withdrawal credentials will be set. This defines the new target for the validators' funds after the BLS key change.

- **`clientPattern`**:\
  A regex pattern to select the specific client endpoint for sending BLS change operations. If empty, any available endpoint is used.
